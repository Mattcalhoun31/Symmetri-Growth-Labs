You are a world-class landing page designer, front-end engineer, and conversion copywriter.

Build a single-page marketing site for **Symmetri Growth Labs**.

Tone:
- Maverick, confident, clear.
- 9th–10th grade reading level.
- No boardroom jargon. No fluff.
- Feels like the future of sales, but simple to understand.

Brand & Visual System:
- Dark carbon-black background with a subtle 3D grid / “holodeck” floor.
- Accent colors: vivid orange (#ff7a1a), cyan/teal (#38e8ff), warm yellow/gold (#ffc84d), soft gray cards.
- Typeface: bold, modern sans-serif with strong weight contrast (like a mix of Satoshi / Inter / Space Grotesk style).
- Visual motif: **chaos → symmetry**. Left side = noisy particles / signals, right side = ordered nodes and clean UI cards.
- Layout must be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Global Interaction & Animation:
- Use scroll-triggered animations (IntersectionObserver, no heavy frameworks).
- Elements should gently **fade up / slide in** from bottom or sides, with small delays to create rhythm.
- Grid background has a slow parallax drift.
- Small glowing “signal” orbs pulse and move subtly in the background, never blocking text.
- Hover states on cards and buttons: soft glow, slight scale-up, subtle shadow.
- Keep animations performant and respectful of prefers-reduced-motion.

==================================================
SECTION 1 – HERO: “AUTONOMOUS REVENUE ENGINE”
==================================================

Goal:
Immediately communicate that Symmetri is a **Revenue OS** that unifies **outbound + ABM**, powered by multi-agent AI and human GTM strategy, running pipeline on autopilot.

Layout:
- Left: text + primary / secondary CTAs.
- Right: animated **OS diagram** card cluster.
- Background: 3D grid floor fading into darkness, with a cone of “scanning light” coming from the OS.

Hero Copy:

Small badge above headline:
> ABM + Outbound. Unified.

Main headline (two-line, very bold, mix of white and orange):
> Autonomous Revenue Engine.  
> Modern Sales Outreach Made Simple.

Subhead:
> Symmetri Growth Labs combines GTM strategy, a multi-agent Revenue OS, and STEALTH™ phone coaching to run your outbound and ABM motions on autopilot. Agents research, write, and reach out while your team focuses on real conversations.

Two primary buttons:
- CTA 1 (solid orange):
  > Calculate Your Savings
- CTA 2 (dark outline):
  > See the OS in Action

Under-headline confidence line in small muted text:
> Built for B2B teams selling into complex buying committees across SaaS, Tech, and Enterprise services.

Hero OS Diagram (right side):

Create an animated diagram that visually explains the Symmetri Revenue OS:

- Center: glowing circular node labeled **“Symmetri Revenue OS”**.
- Orbiting modules (cards with small icons):
  1. **Living Data & Signal Core**
  2. **Autonomous Multi-Agent Platform**
  3. **STEALTH™ Calling Layer**
  4. **GTM Strategy & Control Room**

- Lines connect each module back to the core, with small pulsing “data packets” traveling along the lines.
- On hover or idle animation, individual modules slightly glow and show tiny micro-labels like:
  - “ABM account maps”
  - “Persona-level research”
  - “Spam-safe call flows”
  - “Next Best Action”

Make this diagram reusable later on the page as well.

==================================================
SECTION 2 – THE AI PARADOX + GTM COLLAPSE
==================================================

This section sits directly under the hero, full width, with a slightly darker background band.

Left side: 3 bold stats in large type.

Stats (big white/orange numbers with small captions):
- 2% – Average success rate of cold calls.
- 2% – Average success rate of cold emails.
- 80% – Buyers expect personalized outreach.

Right side: text block, heading + 2 paragraphs.

Heading:
> AI was a game changer. Now it’s a problem.

Body:
> AI promised speed, scale, and smarter outreach. It delivered all of that—plus a flood of noise. Inboxes are full of robotic messages. LinkedIn is a wall of templates. Callers sound like scripts, not people.  
> 
> Prospects are tired. They ignore almost everything. Yet 80% still expect personalized outreach. The result: a paradox where more technology creates less connection.

Below that, a subheading + short bullets:

Subheading:
> The 2025 GTM Collapse

Three concise bullets:
> • SDRs now need hundreds of touches to book a single meeting.  
> • CRM data decays so fast that most “target lists” are already wrong.  
> • ABM plans never reach their full potential because the data and outreach can’t keep up.

Close with a one-line bridge:
> To fix this, you don’t need more tools. You need a new operating system.

==================================================
SECTION 3 – INTRODUCING SYMMETRI REVENUE OS
==================================================

Background: subtle glow behind the OS diagram reused, slightly zoomed.

Section heading:
> Meet Symmetri Revenue OS

Subhead:
> A Smart Opportunity & Autonomous Revenue Accelerator that unifies ABM and outbound into one living system.

Layout:
Two rows:

Row 1 – short explanation:
> Instead of juggling point tools and burned-out SDRs, you get an operating system that keeps your data alive, watches the market for signals, and deploys agents that handle research, messaging, and outreach automatically.

Row 2 – Four core pillars (cards):

Card 1 – **Living Data & Signal Core**  
Copy:
> Your CRM becomes a living engine. We verify and enrich contacts, map buying committees, and monitor intent signals so your ABM and outbound plays always start from clean, current data.

Card 2 – **Autonomous Multi-Agent Platform**  
Copy:
> A team of AI agents researches each account, drafts on-brand messages using your content, and runs coordinated outreach across email, LinkedIn, and other channels. From signal to “next best action,” everything is handled automatically.

Card 3 – **STEALTH™ Calling Layer**  
Copy:
> Phone outreach is scanned by AI long before a human picks up. Our STEALTH™ methodology and scripts train your team to beat spam detection, protect trust scores, and dramatically increase connect rates.

Card 4 – **GTM Strategy & Control Room**  
Copy:
> Symmetri’s experts design the GTM strategy, build campaigns, and tune the OS. You get a single control room to see accounts, signals, conversations, and pipeline in one place.

Animation:
- When the section scrolls into view, the OS diagram from the hero subtly expands and the four pillar cards animate out from the center with gentle motion.

==================================================
SECTION 4 – 30-DAY ACTIVATION: HUMAN + AI SYMBIOSIS
==================================================

This replaces and upgrades the current “Human-AI Symbiosis” timeline.

Heading:
> From Chaos to Symmetry in 30 Days

Subhead:
> We don’t just hand you software. We install the Revenue OS, train your team, and fly alongside you until the system is running on autopilot.

Visual:
- Vertical or diagonal timeline with 6–7 steps, alternating left/right cards.
- Each step has a small icon, title, and a one-sentence description.
- Background grid continues but darker to keep focus on cards.

Steps & copy (use these exact titles):

1. **Deep Dive Evaluation**  
   > We audit your ICP, ABM targets, sales process, tech stack, and team. No assumptions. Just a clear picture of where you are.

2. **GTM Architecture**  
   > Together we design a focused GTM strategy for both outbound and ABM, including targets, offers, and buying committee maps.

3. **Self-Sustaining Data Engine**  
   > We connect 70+ data sources to clean, enrich, and expand your account and contact data. Decay is replaced with a living, always-on data core.

4. **Autonomous Multi-Agent Platform**  
   > We configure the agents that research accounts, pull from your content, and trigger the next best action whenever a signal fires or a real person responds—so qualified meetings get booked 24/7 on autopilot.

5. **Tech & Voice Layer**  
   > We wire in your calling stack, email domains, and LinkedIn presence, making sure every channel is aligned and ready for agent hand-off.

6. **STEALTH™ Coaching & Co-Execution**  
   > We run live outbound with your SDRs, demonstrating STEALTH™ call flows and message reframes that avoid spam labels and raise connection rates.

7. **Autopilot Handoff**  
   > Once the system is stable, agents and signals handle the heavy lifting. Your team focuses on high-value conversations. We stay available as your Growth OS partner.

Animations:
- Cards slide in sequentially as the user scrolls down the timeline.
- A subtle glowing “signal” travels along the spine of the timeline.

==================================================
SECTION 5 – “WE PROCESS THE NOISE” (STRIKE CHAIN + SIGNALS)
==================================================

This section merges the “We process the noise. You get the signal.” block with the “Symmetri Strike Chain” concept.

Heading:
> We process the noise. You get the signal.

Subhead:
> While most teams are blasting generic outreach, your OS is scanning the market, triangulating real buying intent, and acting in seconds.

Layout:
- Left: four small stat cards in a 2×2 grid.
- Right: live-feeling log window showing “Processing Node…” / “MATCH” / “SCORE” style messages.

Stats:
- 147k+ Daily Signals Processed  
- 0.8s Signal-to-Action  
- 99%+ Data Accuracy (multi-source verified)  
- 3.2× Pipeline Lift vs. client’s old playbooks

Below stats, introduce the **Symmetri Strike Chain** – three horizontally aligned cards:

1. **Target Acquisition**  
   > We lock onto high-intent accounts using hiring, funding, technology, and engagement signals. You only chase accounts that are actually in motion.

2. **Stealth Infiltration**  
   > Multi-agent outreach surrounds the buying committee with on-point messages and stealth-safe calls, bypassing spam filters and gatekeepers.

3. **Revenue Extraction**  
   > When the time is right, agents and reps trigger direct, clear calls-to-action that lead to meetings and deals—not random check-ins.

Animation:
- Each Strike Chain card glows in sequence, like steps in a mission.
- A thin line with small moving dots connects card 1 → 2 → 3.

==================================================
SECTION 6 – DATA ENGINE + TRIANGULATION
==================================================

Two-part section.

Part A – Living Data Engine

Heading:
> Static data is dead. Meet the Living Engine.

Copy:
> Your CRM decays by up to 30% every year. Symmetri installs a self-healing data core that verifies contacts, fills in missing roles, and keeps ABM account maps accurate day and night.

Stats under the copy:
- 75+ Data Providers  
- 24/7 Auto-Healing  
- 30% Annual Decay Fixed

Right side visual:
- Card stack representing a CRM contact list where rows show “Updated” badges sliding in next to names, job titles changing, and one bad contact row marked with a subtle red “Invalid” and removed.

Part B – Triangulation

Sub-heading:
> We don’t guess. We triangulate.

Body:
> Instead of guessing who to email this week, the OS watches signals across LinkedIn, intent tools, firmographic changes, and your own engagement data. When a buying window opens, agents know who to contact, on which channel, with what message.

Three mini-cards:
- **Alert** – “Champion promoted or moved.”  
- **Signal** – “New funding or strategic initiative announced.”  
- **Intent** – “Competitor contract at risk / tool removed.”

==================================================
SECTION 7 – STEALTH™ PROTOCOL
==================================================

This section should feel like a special “terminal” interface.

Heading:
> Protocol: S.T.E.A.L.T.H.™

Sub-heading:
> Most calls are scored by AI before a human ever hears you. We engineered the first anti-detection protocol.

One-sentence value line:
> Protect your phone trust scores, avoid “Spam Likely” labels, and raise connect rates without sounding like a robot.

Layout:
- Large terminal-style card with:
  - Input text area labelled “Your current opener or script”.
  - A “Scan Script” button that, when clicked, runs a fake diagnostic and shows:
    - “AI Scanner Result: PASSED – AI Invisible” or “FAILED – High Detection Risk”.
  - Below: a button “Apply STEALTH™ Reframing”.

- Under the main panel: three small “Casualty Report” cards:
  1. Hang-Up Rate +70% – Cause: “Are you busy right now?”  
  2. Spam Flag Probability +20% – Cause: “Guarantee / Free / Limited Time”.  
  3. Meetings Booked –28% – Cause: “Just checking in…”

Under that, a row of 7 small tiles S T E A L T H, lightly animated.

==================================================
SECTION 8 – BEFORE / AFTER: MANUAL VS AGENTIC
==================================================

Heading:
> 2015 Playbooks vs. 2025 Agentic Operations

Layout:
Two side-by-side panels.

Left panel title:
> Manual Playbooks

Bullets:
> • Spray-and-pray emails  
> • 3–7 day research cycles  
> • SDRs buried in tabs and tools  
> • Little to no ABM execution  
> • Burnout and high turnover

Right panel title:
> Agentic Operations

Bullets:
> • Signal-driven targeting  
> • Real-time “next best action”  
> • Agents handle research + follow-up  
> • ABM and outbound from one OS  
> • SDRs focused on real conversations

==================================================
SECTION 9 – ROI CALCULATOR: AI AGENTS VS HUMAN CAPITAL
==================================================

Keep this section, but make the positioning clearer.

Heading:
> AI Agents vs. Human Capital

Subhead:
> See the real cost of manual outbound vs. an autonomous Revenue OS.

Layout:
- Left: calculator card with sliders:
  - Team members doing outbound
  - Average salary
  - Hours per week on outbound

- Right: summary box that estimates:
  - Hours recovered per month
  - Estimated meetings gained
  - Potential outbound cost savings (%)

Accompanying copy under the calculator:
> Most teams save 60–85% on outbound labor while increasing meetings by 2–3× once the OS is fully live.

==================================================
SECTION 10 – EXECUTION PARTNERS, NOT JUST A TOOL
==================================================

Heading:
> Not just a platform. Your Growth Execution Partners.

Subhead:
> Symmetri Growth Labs brings GTM operators, AI engineers, and STEALTH™ coaches into one team that builds and runs your Revenue OS with you.

Four square cards:

1. **GTM Strategy**  
   > We go deep on your market, offers, and motion to design a funnel that matches how your buyers actually decide.

2. **Autonomous Outreach Platform**  
   > Multi-agent campaigns across email, LinkedIn, and phone, all orchestrated from one interface.

3. **STEALTH™ Calling Methodology**  
   > We train your team on calling patterns that avoid spam flags and keep conversations feeling human.

4. **Living Data & Signal Core**  
   > We keep your ABM and outbound campaigns powered by clean, current data and real-time market signals.

==================================================
SECTION 11 – FINAL CTA
==================================================

Heading:
> Ready to build pipeline on autopilot?

Subhead:
> Get a 30-day activation plan that shows exactly how a Revenue OS, STEALTH™, and ABM-ready data engine can work for your team.

Two buttons:
- Primary: **Book a Strategy Session**
- Secondary (ghost): **See a Live OS Walkthrough**

Underneath, in very small text:
> No pressure, no generic demo. We build a live view of how Symmetri Revenue OS would run your motion before you decide.

==================================================
CODING NOTES
==================================================

- Use semantic HTML5 sections.
- Use CSS variables for colors and spacing.
- Implement scroll animations with IntersectionObserver and CSS classes for fade-in / slide-up.
- Make the OS diagram and STEALTH terminal feel interactive but keep JS light.
- Ensure all text has strong contrast on the dark background.
- Ensure mobile layout stacks sections vertically and keeps text readable (no tiny fonts).

End of prompt.
